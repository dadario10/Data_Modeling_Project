## Overview 
In this project we created predictive models to predict the 'bounce-back' of stock price for Amazon, Netfix and Nikola stock prices.  We compared the predictive models to the actual data for the same time period  

## Purpose
The purpose of our study is to:
* Extract, clean and pre-process data for models. 
* Build multiple machine learning models to predict selective stock market stocks spanning COVID-19 global pandemic and predict the 'bounce back' of the stock vs. actual prefromance of the selective stocks. 
* Compare each of the machine learning predictive models to the actual performance of the selected stocks. 
*  
* Use a Tableau HTML, to visualize models' prediction.

## Technologies 
* Python & Pandas
* Jupyter Notebook 
* Visual Studio
* MySql Database 
* xGBoost 

## Data
### Data Source

Three stocks specific stocks were chosen - Amazon, Netflix and Nikola.  All 3 stocks are listed on the NASDAX Stock exchange.  The data was gathered from Yahoo Finance:

* [Nikola](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/quote/NKLA?p=NKLA&.tsrc=fin-srch)

### Data Cleaning
